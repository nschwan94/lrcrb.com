          p what i propose to do is offer a novel interpretation of pills
          p red and blue pills are not two divergent paths rather semicircles
          p for reasons i do not fully understand my journey in this life 
          p has traversed the subtle geographies of these tokens
          p i wondered as a boy what my purpose was and dreamed of 
          p such things as pursuing the olympics, medicine, law, or space
          p as it turns out i believe now that my destiny was simply to exist 
          p observe and offer careful contributions to the daily menagerie of
          p the great stage act we all find ourselves thrust into
          p ive now reached an age where i have a chance to synthesize
          p what i know into a useful totem of our culture 
          p the task before me is daunting as i have always harbored 
          p doubts in my own abilities owing to numerous failures
          p the truth will set me free, the truth will set us all free 
          p what i believe is that there are various mechanisms
          p biological and social that constrain our realities
          p making many of us unable to ever achieve truth and freedom
          p my hope is that happiness is reachable for all 
          p but every day the world provides examples of the unfairness 
          p of our situation on a massive spinning ball flying through a
          p vast chasm of sifting nothingness illuminated by physical laws 
          p that themselves suggest futility given our human limitations  
          p i write to extend my reach in time and space and i wonder what
          p my ancestors have written or documented that is now lost
          p what they have given me is a codex that is excruciatingly 
          p difficult to interpret given the tools of memory and logic 
          p aided by formerly impossible technological advancements
          p of the age we find ourselves in when were not dreaming 
          p please join me in this pursuit and let us achieve something 
          p that is greater than the sum of our parts you know how to find me 
          p because i am not anonymous instead i am transparent to a fault 
          p it makes me vulnerable but also makes me strong let us build 
          p a better world simply by connecting the dots of our entropy
